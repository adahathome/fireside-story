    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>And shaggy and scooby were walking down a spooky woodland road to the cabin...</p>
    <p>And they were getting rained on <strong>SO HARD</strong> by the rain...</p>
    <P>All of sudden they smelled the robust scent of anchovie pizza coming from a dark abandoned home</P>
    <p>And they knew there must be friends inside the <em>dark abandoned home</em>because anchovie pizza is what all the cool kids eat.....</p>
